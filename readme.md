# ZingTouch 
https://zingchart.github.io/zingtouch

A modern JavaScript touch gesture library. The library allows developers to
configure pre-existing gestures as well as create their own using ZingTouch's
life cycle.

# Overview

ZingTouch is built to make implementing gestures for the browser as easy or
complex as you need it to be. ZingTouch comes with 6 main gestures :

* Tap
* Swipe
* Pinch
* Expand
* Pan
* Rotate

These gestures can be customized including the number of inputs it accepts, or
how sensitive the gesture is to be recognized.

ZingTouch is also has lifecycle events that you can hook into to create new
Gestures or to act upon certain touch events. We know supporting touch events
across multiple browsers can be a pain; ZingTouch makes it easy by defining 3
hooks to pass callbacks to :

* start
* move
* end


# Getting Started

### Include the library


***Node / CommonJS***

```js
var ZingTouch = require('zingtouch');
```

or

***Include the file***

```html
<script src='./path/to/zingtouch.min.js'></script>
```

or

***ES6***

```js
import ZingTouch from 'zingtouch';
```


### Create a Region

```js
var zt = new ZingTouch.Region(document.body);
```

### Bind an element to a gesture

```js
var myElement = document.getElementById('my-div');

zt.bind(myElement, 'tap', function(e){
	//Actions here
}, false);
```

## Constructs

### Region

```js
new Region(element, [capture], [preventDefault])
```
 * element - The element to set the listener upon
 * capture - Whether the region listens for captures or bubbles.
 * preventDefault - Disables browser functionality such as scrolling and zooming
   over the region.

Regions specify an area to listen for all window events. ZingTouch needs to
listen to all window events in order to determine if a gesture is recognized.
Note that you can reuse regions for multiple elements and gesture bindings. They
simply specify an area where to listen for gestures.

Suppose you had an element that you wanted to track gestures on. We set the
region on that element along with binding it to a gesture.

```js
var touchArea = document.getElementById('toucharea');
var myRegion = new ZingTouch.Region(touchArea);

myRegion.bind(touchArea, 'swipe', function(e){
	console.log(e.detail);
});
```

The shaded area in blue shows the area where ZingTouch will now listen for
events such as touchstart, touchmove, touchend, etc.

![Region](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/region.png)


But humans aren't perfect. Suppose the element #toucharea were to listen for the
`Swipe` gesture. The tracking of the window events will stop when the user
reaches the edges of #toucharea. But what if the user didn't finish until say
10-50px ***outside*** the element? Regions are here to help.

Suppose you set the Region to the parent of the #toucharea element instead.

```js
var parentTouchArea = document.getElementById('parent-toucharea')
var touchArea = document.getElementById('toucharea')
var myRegion = new ZingTouch.Region(parentTouchArea);

myRegion.bind(touchArea, 'swipe', function(e){
	console.log(e.detail);
});
```

![Parent Region](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/parent-region.png)

ZingTouch now tracks the swipe gesture inside the `#toucharea` element AND the
#parent-toucharea. This allows some forgiveness when the user tries to swipe on
the `#toucharea`, but lifts their finger somewhere in the `#parent-toucharea`.

**Note:** The swipe gesture can only be initiated on the area it is bound to.
This means the user has to being touching the `#toucharea` element first, but
can move out and end within `#parent-toucharea` and including `#toucharea`.


### Multiple Regions

Regions only are aware of themselves and their contents, not across regions.
This allows for control at a larger scale so you can group similar gestures
together. While you can throw a Region on top of the `document.body`, we suggest
splitting up your application into regions for better performance -- the less
bindings a single region has to iterate through to detect a gesture, the better.

![Multiple Regions](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/multiple-regions.png)


## Gestures
Gesture classes can be instatiated to generate modified versions.

### Tap

![Tap Gesture](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/tap.gif)

A tap is detected when the user touches the screen and releases in quick succession.

#### Options

* `options.maxDelay` *optional* - The maximum delay between a start and end
  event. This number is measured in milliseconds.
  * default: 300
* `options.numInputs` *optional* - The number of inputs to trigger the tap
  event.
  * default: 1
* `options.tolerance` *optional* - A tolerance value which allows the user to
  move their finger about a radius measured in pixels. This allows the Tap
  gesture to be triggered more easily since a User might move their finger
  slightly during a tap event.
  * default: 10

#### Example

```js
new ZingTouch.Tap({
	maxDelay: 200,
	numInputs: 2,
	tolerance: 125
})
```

#### Emits

* `interval` - a time measured in milliseconds between the start of the gesture,
  and the end.

---

### Swipe

![Swipe Gesture](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/swipe.gif)

A swipe is detected when the user touches the screen and moves in a relatively
increasing velocity, leaving the screen at some point before it drops below a
certain velocity.

#### Options

* `options.numInputs` *optional* - The number of inputs to trigger the event.
	* Default: 1
* `options.escapeVelocity` *optional* - The minimum velocity (px/ms) that the
  gesture has to obtain by the end event.
  * Default: 0.2
* `options.maxRestTime` *optional* - The amount of time allowed in milliseconds
  inbetween events before a the motion becomes inelligible to be a swipe.
  * Default: 100


#### Example
```js
new ZingTouch.Swipe({
	numInputs: 2,
	maxRestTime: 100,
	escapeVelocity: 0.25
});
```

#### Emits
An array of data objects containing:
* `velocity` - The value in units of pixels per millisecond the gesture was
  travelling until it's ending point.
* `currentDirection` - The angle the swipe ended at in degrees, relative to the
  unit circle. (e.g. straight down is 270deg while straight left is 180deg).

Each index represents an input that participated in the event.

---

### Pinch

![Pinch Gesture](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/pinch.gif)

A pinch is detected when the user has two inputs on the screen and moves one or
both closer towards the other input.

#### Example
```js
new ZingTouch.Pinch()
```

#### Emits

* `distance` - The distance in pixels between the two inputs.

---

### Expand

![Expand Gesture](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/expand.gif)

An expand is detected when the user has two inputs on the screen and moves one
or both away from the other input.

#### Example
```js
new ZingTouch.Expand()
```

#### Emits

* `expand` - The distance in pixels between the two inputs.

---

### Pan

![Pan Gesture](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/pan.gif)

A pan is detected when the user touches the screen and moves about the area.

#### Options
* `options.numInputs` *optional* - The number of inputs to trigger the event.
	* Default: 1
* `options.threshold` *optional* - The minimum number of pixels the input has to
  move to trigget this gesture.
   * Default: 1

#### Example
```js
new ZingTouch.Pan({
	numInputs: 2
})
```

#### Emits

An array of data objects containing:
* `distanceFromOrigin` - The distance in pixels traveled from the current
  position from the starting position.
* `directionFromOrigin` - The angle of the pan in degrees, relative to the unit
  circle.(e.g. straight down is 270deg while straight left is 180deg). The
  starting point of where the input began during the "start" event denotes the
  origin point.
* `currentDirection` - The angle of the pan gesture in degrees, relative to the
  unit circle. The previously emitted point is used as an origin point.

Each index represents an input that participated in the event.


---

### Rotate

![Rotate Gesture](http://demos.zingchart.com/assets/zingtouch-docs/rotate.gif)

A Rotate is detected when:
 * the user has two inputs moving about a circle on the edges of a diameter.
 * the user has one input moving in a circular motion around the center point of
   the bound target element.

#### Example
```js
new ZingTouch.Rotate()
```

#### Emits

* `angle` - The angle of the initial right most input, in relation to the unit
  circle.
* `distanceFromOrigin` - The angular distance travelled by the initial right
  most input.
* `distanceFromLast` - The change of angle between the last position and the
  current position. Positive denotes a counter-clockwise motion, while negative
  denotes a clockwise motion.

---

### Gesture

A generic gesture. By default, this gesture does not emit but is useful for
hooking into ZingTouch's life cycle. See [ZingTouch Life
Cycle](#zingtouch-life-cycle) for more information.

#### Example
```js
new ZingTouch.Gesture()
```


## Methods

### Region.bind(element, gesture, handler, [capture])
Binds a single element to a gesture, executing the handler when the gesture is
emitted.

**Parameters**

* element - A DOM element
* gesture - Either the key (string) of a default or registered gesture, or an
  instance of the `Gesture` class itself.
* handler - A function to be called every time the gesture is emitted.
	* The handler function has an Event object emitted from the 
  [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent)
  interface. Any information relavant to the gesture will be in `event.detail`.
* `capture` - An optional boolean to designate the event to be fired on the
  capture or bubbling phase.

**Example #1**

```js
var myRegion = new ZingTouch.Region(document.body);
var myElement = document.getElementById('some-div');

myRegion.bind(myElement, 'tap', function(e) {
	console.log('Tap gesture emitted: ' + e.detail.interval);
});
```

**Example #2**

```js
var myElement = document.getElementById('some-div');
var myTapGesture = new ZingTouch.Tap({ maxDelay : 100 });
var myRegion = new ZingTouch.Region(document.body);

myRegion.bind(myElement, myTapGesture, function(e) {
	console.log('Custom Tap gesture emitted: ' + e.detail.interval);
}, false);
```

**Notes**

1. Instance Gestures that are passed to bind will be stored and maintained in
   memory, therefore it is reccomended to reuse gestures object where possible,
   or to use the `Region.register` syntax -- they essentially do the same thing.
   Either works fine, but try to avoid using the following pattern where an
   instance variable is created at every bind :

```js
//Poor performance
var delay = 100;
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++){
	myRegion.bind(
    myElement, 
    new ZingTouch.Tap({maxDelay : delay}),
    function(e){...}
  );
}

```

```js
//Better performance
var delay = 100;
var customTap = new ZingTouch.Tap({maxDelay : delay});
for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++){
	myRegion.bind(myElement, customTap, function(e){...});
}

```
---

### Region.bind(element)
Passing a qualified DOM element to the bind function will return an object that
can be chainable with the 6 main gestures, or any other gestures that you may
have registered with `Region.register`

**Parameters**

* element - A DOM element

**Returns**

* A chainable object that takes two parameters :
	* `handler` - A function to be called every time the gesture is emitted.
    * The chainable object has 6 methods available at all times : `.tap()`
      ,`.swipe()` ,`.pinch()` ,`.expand()` ,`.pan()` ,`.rotate()`. Custom
      Gesture are accessible using the `ZingTouch.register` method.
    * The handler function has an Event object emitted from the
      [CustomEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent)
      interface. Any information relavant to the gesture will be in
      `event.detail`.

  * `capture` - An optional boolean to designate the event to be fired on the
    capture or bubbling phase.


**Example**

```js
var myElement = document.getElementById('mydiv');
var myRegion = new ZingTouch.Region(myElement);
var chainableObject = myRegion.bind(myElement);

chainableObject
	.tap(function(e){
		console.log(e.detail);
	})
	.swipe(function(e){
		console.log(e.detail);
	}, true)
```
---

### Region.bindOnce()
Identical to both method signatures of bind, but is "bound once" meaning the
event will only be captured once before it is destroyed.

See [Region.bind](#bind)

---

### Region.unbind(element, [gesture])
Unbinds an element from a specific gesture, or all gestures if none is
specified.

**Parameters**

* `element` - A DOM element
* `gesture` *optional* - Either a registered gesture's key (String) or the
  gesture object used to bind the element.

**Returns**

* array - An array of bindings containing the gestures that were unbound.


**Examples**

Unbind from a specific gesture

```js
var myElement = document.getElementById('mydiv');
myRegion.unbind(myElement, 'tap');
```

Unbind from all gestures

```js
var myElement = document.getElementById('mydiv');
myRegion.unbind(myElement);
```

Unbind from a gesture instance.

```js
var myElement = document.getElementById('mydiv');
var myRegion = new ZingTouch.Region(document.body);
var myTapGesture = new ZingTouch.Tap({ maxDelay : 100 });

myRegion.bind(myElement, myTapGesture, function(e) {});

myRegion.unbind(myElement, myTapGesture);

```
---

### Region.register(key, gesture)
Register a gesture of the Gesture class to each Region. Allows the newly
registered Gesture to be accessible in the bind/unbind syntax including the
chainable object of bind.

**Parameters**

* `key` - A string to identify the new gesture.
* `gesture` - An instance of the Gesture class

**Returns**

* The gesture object registered

**Examples**

```js
var myTapGesture = new ZingTouch.Tap({ maxDelay : 60 });

var myRegion = new ZingTouch.Region(document.body);
myRegion.register('shortTap', myTapGesture);
```
And the usages :

```js
myRegion.bind(myElement, 'shortTap', function(e){});
```

```js
myRegion.bind(myElement).shortTap(function(e){});
```
---

### Region.unregister(key)
Unregisters a gesture that was previously registered. Unregistering a gesture
will automatically unbind any elements that were bound to this gesture.

**Parameters**

* `key` - A string to identify the gesture that will be unregistered.

**Returns**

* The gesture that was unregistered.

**Example**

```js
myRegion.unregister('shortTap');
```

# ZingTouch Life Cycle

Utilizing ZingTouch's life cycle (start, move, end) allows you to create new
gestures and to interface with the mobile event cycle in a much finer detail. It
will allow you to hook into events and to apply external functions during
events.  Imagine the `Pan` gesture allowing in-between events to be triggered:

* Pan - start
* Pan - move
* Pan - end
* Pan -> Event detected.

The syntax for utilizing the life cycle is still to be determined, but will be
released in the near future.

---

# Pitfalls

**Binding an event and DOM mutation to an element**
ZingTouch treats a gesture as a non-mutable event, meaning that the element is
bound to is not expected to change between the start and end. Binding a
transformation of an element's bounding box to the middle of a gesture event
could provide unwanted results. 

Example: Binding a pan event directly to an element that you want to move around
every time the callback is fired. The initial state of when the gesture was
registered changes throughout the event, and the initial reference point is no
longer valid. 

Solution: Attach the gesture listener to a non-mutating element such as a parent
container, and modify your target element in the callback. This will provide a
more predictable state that zingtouch can recognize.  ---
