# westures 

Westures is intended to be a lightweight JavaScript gesture detection library.
Whether it achieves that goal at this point is... yet to be determined.

This module includes `westures-core` as well as a base set of gestures.

## Advisory

This is an alpha release of this project. It is very much still in development,
and has not been tested beyond a handful of devices using the latest versions of
Chrome and Firefox. If you find a problem with it, please let me know.

Westures is a fork of [ZingTouch](https://github.com/zingchart/zingtouch).

## Under Construction

This readme document is still under construction. I will be updating it soon.
